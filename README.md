### Hi there 👋

I'm a developper who want to collaborate on Security/VideoGames/WebApp and differents Web Packages.<br>
My last works are on Scrapping Application with Scrapping Tools (📦**puppeteer 📦php-webdriver**), Website Creation and Video Games (🎮**NamcoPacman**) 

My school career was based on C/C_system and I want to found a really big project in this langage for conclude this chapter of my life it's possible ?

Because C is very rareful in company but in community it's possible to develop anything with any language.<br>
That's my community wish/researchs!!

But now if we are a **recrutor** of a compagny I'm open to work with PHP in any usage (object,basic,script,Web,Framework).<br> 
I'm interested by the entire stack of Web Développement (SQL->PHP->JS->CSS/HTML) and I'm work with these languages as soon an idea travel my mind.

For my differents School projects we can see all in **_School_** 📁<br>
The others projects are public 📁
  - **HTMLBuilder** 
  - **Scrapper**
  - **RecipesWebsite**
  - **PriceComparator**
